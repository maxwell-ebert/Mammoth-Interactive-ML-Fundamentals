#Session 1 notes - 1/4/2023

A. Types of ML Models

Group 1 - Clustering models - used to group similar objects. Ex. can group customers - most likely to buy product vs unlikely to buy. Helps label data for Supervised Machine Learning.
	-Supervised ML relies on labelled input data to learn a function that can be used on unlabeled data. Ex- every image must have a description of the image (i.e dog, cat, person, etc)
	-Since supervised ML requires labelled data, clustering models help provide a means for labelling data. 
	-Some examples of clustering algorithms:
		1. K means
		2. K means ++
		3. K medioids
		4. Agglomerative clustering DBSCAN

Group 2 - Regression Models
	- Output variable can take continuous values
		- Example - predicting a price of an item based on features (i.e. Price of car based on features.)
				  - predict value of stock based on history
	- Some examples of Regression Algorithms:
		1. Linear Regression
		2. Lasso Regression
		3. Ridge Regression
		4. SVM Regression
		5. Decision Tree Regression

Group 3 - Deep Learning
	- Neural Networks
	- Attempts to mimic the human brain with neural network algorithm structure
	- Deep learning commonly used for classifying images
		- Neural network can learn what is inside images based on features. 

	- Some examples of Deep Learning Applications
		1. Computer Vision
			- Anything that has to do with visual applications (Classifying images, etc)
		2. Natural Language Processing
			- Anything dealing with understanding speech and text
			- can train algorithim to read/write
		3. Autonomous Vehicles
		4. Image Filtering
		5. Text Generation

Group 4 - Classification Models
	- Predict type of object within a number of options
		- Categorical versus continuous
		- Not trying to find best fit trend line, but rather separating data into different classes
	- Some Applications of Classification Models:
		1. Check Email for spam
		2. Check reviews for positive/negative
		3. Check Species of a flower
	- Some Examples of Classification Algorithms:
		1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
		2. Naive Bayes
		3. Logistic Regression
		4. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
		5. Decision Tree
		6. Ensemble - combination of any classification algorithms 
	- K-Nearest Neighbors
		- Assumes that similar things are near to each other
		- Calculates distance between points on a graph to identify similar objects
			- Plots every data point onto a graph based on different values
			- Objects with similar properties will be 'close' to each other on that graph
	- Naive Bayes
		- Assumes the presence of a feature in a class is unrelated to other features
		- A cat has whiskers, a tail and a nose, but each of these features is independent
			- Similar to KNN
		- Common project - flowers, Have 3 types of flowers (Virginica, Versicolor, Setosa)
			- plot by petal length (x axis) and petal width (y axis)
			- if 2 flowers are close to each other on plot, then those flowers are likely the same species 
	- Logistic Regression
		- Used when dependent variable (target) is categorical
		- Example: is a review positive or negative
		- Example: is an email spam or not
		- Feed in independent variables (x1, x2, x3, etc), and algorithm can determine results
	- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
		- Finds plane that has the maximum distance between data points of both classes

B. How Does A Machine Learning Agent Learn
	- In the context of ML, what is learning?
		- A ML agent can improve its ability to perform a task through experience
	-Machine Learning Agent
		- So far, an agent's perceptions have helped it choose its actions
		- Now an agent's perceptions will help improve future behavior
		- Learning agents are made up of different parts (including sensors and effectors)
			- Peformance Element
				- Gets data from sensors
					- Sensors 
						- Captures data about the environment
				- Sends Data to Effectors
					- Effectors
						- Sends data to environment	
				- Processes Percepts
					- Percepts = Perceptions
					- Processes different enviromental data that the agent receives
					- Chooses actions
					- This is the same as agents used in search algorithms
			- Learning Element
				- Maintains a relationship with the performance element
				- Sends changes to performance element
				- Receives knowledge from performance element
			    - Back-and-forth relationship with performance element
			    - Learning Element carries out improvements - improves its own performance
			    	- not just doing a task, but also getting better each time the task is performance
			    	- Requires self-knowledge
			    	- Requires feedback
			    		- Receives feedback from Critic Element
			    		- When we build ML models, we provide feedback by which it improves
			- Critic Element
				- Critic element gets info from sensors
				- Also gets information from performance standard (?)
				- Sends feedback to the learning element
				- Evaluates agent's behavior
				- Uses external behavior measure
					- Example: If our model is a classification model, user can evaluate agent's behavior based on whether or not
					  data was correctly classified
					  	- i.e. detecting objects in image - did model correctly identify objects in images, or no?
					  	- This feedback is fed to the critic element, which in turn feeds it to the Learning Agent
		  	- Problem Generator 
		  		- Receives Learning Goals from Learning Element
		  		- Sends information to Performance Element
		  		- Suggest explorative actions to the Performance Element
		  		- Leads agent to new experiences
		- Learning agents exist in an environment, from which inputs and outputs are fed in and out

C. What is Inductive Learning?
	- Pure Inductive Inference
		- For a collection of examples f(x), return an h(x) (hypothesis) that approximates f
			- For example, a best fit line in a linear regression analysis would be the h(x) in the above statement
			- Approximates the actual function
		- Good hypothesis
			- Should generalize data well
			- Should predict unseen examples correctly
				- Need to make sure hypothesis function gives accurate results
		- Consistent Hypothesis
			- Consistent with the dataset if hypothesis agrees with all data
			- Otherwise, hypothesis is not consistent
		- Choosing hypothesis
			- Aim for the simplest, most consistent hypothesis
				- Occam's Razor
			- If you have several valid, consistent hypotheses, choose the simplest one
			
D. Python Language Basics
	- Topics
		- Intro to Python
		- Variables and Operators
		- Collection types
		- Conditionals and Loops
		- Functions
		- Classes and Ojbects (might not even touch on these in this course, but writing this down as a reference to revisit later)

E. What is google colab
	- Refer to colab file in git
F. What If I get Errors
	- literally google it lmao (I'm not joking, that's the point of this vid. There's a feature in colab that does it for you. It's literally a stack overflow button)
G. How do I terminate A Session
	- Terminate session in Google Colab
	- From Runtime drop down menu, select 'Manage Sessions;
		- Will see list of all active session, along with 'Terminate' buttons
		- Can terminate individual sessions, or terminate all at once with 'Terminate All' Button
