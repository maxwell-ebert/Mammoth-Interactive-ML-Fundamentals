1. Probability And Statistics For Machine Learning
a. Distributions in Machine Learning
	- Probability Distributions
		- Random Variables
			- Quantity that is produced by a random process
			- Random variable can take on one of many possible values
				- e.g. events from the state space
				- specific value or set of values for a random variable that can be assigned a probability
				- often denoted as capital letter (e.g. 'X')
					- values of the random variable are denoted as a lowercase letter and an index (e.g. x1, x2, x3)
			- Random Variables have Probability Distributions
				- In addition to calculating likelihood of events, can also be used to summarize likelihood of all possible outcomes
			- The summary of probabilities for the values of a random variable are called a probability distribution
				- Summarizes the relationship between possible values and their probability for a random variable
	- Continuous Probability Distributions
		- One category of probability distributions
		- Continuous Random Variable 
			- Has continuous probability distribution
			- Values are drawn from a range of real-valued numerical values
				- examples include adult height, infant weight, stock prices
			- Continuous probability Distribution describes the relationship between the events for a continuous random variable and their probabilities
			- The probability for a given continuous random variable cannot be specified directly
				- Probability CAN be specified for discrete random variables
				- For continuous random variable, probability is caluclated as an integral (area under the curve) for a tiny interval around a specific outcome
		- Uniform Distribution
			- Common form of continuous probability distribution
			- Uniform distribution refers to constant probabilities across the entire range of values in the domain which is the range of the x-axis for the random variable
				- found in dice rolls, card draws, model parameter for ml, radioactive particles, demand on the economy
			- (refer to colab notebook for this lesson)
				- in our randomly made plot, we see that distribution is mostly uniform (similar counts for values across scale) but is not exact, with some variables. Count is relatively similar for values.
		- Gaussian Distribution
			- Is also commonly called bell-curve distribution, or normal distribution
				- Very commonly used in stats and machine learning
			- Gaussian Distribution, for example, can determine probability of picking heads in coin flip
				- Can appear in sum of dice rolls, or height of people
				- another example is _ scores of pets
				- Covers probability of real-valued events
				- Continuous random variable that has normal distribution is considered normally distributed
			- (refer to colab notebook for this lesson)
		- Log-Normal distributions
			- Means that the natural logarithm of the log-normal distribution is normally distributed
				- examples include income, length of online comments, duration of chess games, duration of rubik's cube solves, size of video files, number of hospitalized cases in a pandemic
					- As income goes up, count of people with higher income decreases
					- Most comments on forums or videos are relatively short, and count of longer-form comments decreases as the number of words in a comment increases
			- in colab example, we see that the highest counts exist at the minimum, but as values increase, counts decrease, and decrease logarithmically 
				- IMPORTANT: Log-normal data is not itself normally distributed 
					- However, the LOG of the data is normally distributed, and we can see this when we create a normal plot of the log of our log-normal data (see colab) 				
		- Exponential Probability Distribution
			- few outcomes are the most likely
			- rapid decrease in probability to all other outcomes
			- Relatively squished up against zero and then decreases exponentially toward higher values
			- Examples include:
				- Time between requests to access Wikipedia pages
				- Time between clicks on a counter
				- Time until a part fails on a machine
				- Time until someone defaults on a loan 
			- Commonly seen in Deep Learning models
			- Equivalent to geometric probability distribution for discrete random variables
			- When you graph data that is exponentially distributed, it will look very similar to log-normal data, but if you plot the log of exponentially distributed data, it will not be normally distributed
		- Laplace Probability Distribution
			- Also called double exponential distribution
			- Commonly seen in extreme weather events such as maximum rainfall in a day
			- Has many ML applications, typically when an acute peak of probability is desired
			- when you plot data with a laplace distribution, it will take on a bell curve shape, but it is not normally distributed
				- in a laplace distribution, there will be discrepancies or jumps in values on the y-axis
		- Binomial Distribution
			- Binomial distribution is an example of a discrete probability distribution
			- Discrete random variables are variables drawn from a finite set of states
				- Heads/tails
				- is image dog or cat
				- true/false
			- True/false or 1/2 or 0/1 are booleans
			- y-axis of a charted boolean/discrete set shows event probability and x axis shows categories of outcomes
				- lets us see distribution of event probabilities
			- See colab notebook for example of probability testing for coin flips
